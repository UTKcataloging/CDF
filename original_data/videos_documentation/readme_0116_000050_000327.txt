The video for the Chapel Dedication is pretty rough around the edges, so I've listed some of the major issues below.  However, the audio is pretty good for most of the video, so you can at least hear the speeches, singing, etc.

-The audio improves/gets louder around 4 minutes 11 seconds into the video (the first 4 minutes of the recording had loud feedback that had to be cut out, resulting in worse audio for that segment).

-At 36m 6s into the video, there was a gap in the recording, so the "Tracking" bar reappears and the first part of Maya Lin's talk is missing.

-At 1h 17m 12s, there was another gap in the recording, so the video jumps ahead a little and the audio is messed up for ~20s of the singing.

-At 1h 58m 20s, this was the end of the first VHS tape.  The second VHS continued with the same woman speaking, but a few seconds of her talk were lost in between the two, and that annoying "Tracking" bar again reappears for a couple seconds.

-At 2h 39m 10s, there was another gap in the recording and several seconds lost.
