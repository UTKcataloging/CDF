        <abstract>In this report we focus on child care for the children of teen mothers, and the emerging response of schools, social service agencies, Cities, and states to that need. Not nearly enough is being done, but the growing activity in the area holds promise. This report reviews the criteria for good programs, the barriers to creating them, some model programs, and some different state initiatives.</abstract>
